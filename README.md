# Mouse
To-do list.
When doing something on the list, write your name on it to avoid collisions
* When a cat finds the poop they will start tracking the mouse. Poop is represented in the map as '4' , '2', '8', '6'
* Sorting the lines of the leaderboard by score
* Improve structure and readability in main
* Use the struct coor to represent coordinates for struct cat

Ideas
* Negative score when eating poop.
* Boss battle - Mouse eats a big cheese 'O' and gets 999 poops and thus diarrea. A cat will follow the poops and try to catch the mouse. Font get trapped!
